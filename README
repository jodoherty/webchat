This is my first node.js project. I hacked it together over the course
of one weekend in order to get more familiar with node.js. As such, I
avoided using any dependencies and stuck to purely to the modules 
provided by node.js and my knowledge of HTTP and web development. 
Needless to say, it's more than a little messy. 

Sessions and users aren't very well decoupled at this point. I plan on 
cleaning this up in the future.

I plan on allowing users to log in using their SMF forum account, since 
I'm eventually deploying this chat system at The Chrono Compendium:
